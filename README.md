There are no imports for this scripts. So you just download them run. 
DividendROI.py is for the typical investment with an ROI goal.
passiveDividend.py is for the goal of a passive income.

The goal of the scripts is to take past performance for an investement, 5yr growth for example, and give you an accurate prediction on how this stock can perform given some other parameters that you give it. 
1. Current Stock Price - The current value of a stock or investment you are looking into. Needs to be a float/int
2. 5yr Growth - Most investements have a 5yr chart. Looking at that 5yr chart you can see the % growth over those 5yrs.
3. Dividend/Yield - Many investemnts have Dividend/Yield, but not all.
4. How many Shares you own - How many shares of the stock you own, or if you want to run some tests how many the scenario calls for.
5. How much money can you spend a month - this is to help determine how many shares you can continue buying as the price continues to rise.
6.Goal Amount - all the factors above are used to figure out how long, in months, it will take to reach this number. in Dollars($)
